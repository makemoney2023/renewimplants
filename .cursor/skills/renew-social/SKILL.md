# Renew social and paid ads

Blog posts still follow [renew-blog-writing](../renew-blog-writing/SKILL.md). This skill is for Instagram, Facebook, and Meta ads. The feed and the paid catalog are a mix of video, static, and carousel. Do not ship a week or a campaign that is only one of those.

The catalog is `docs/content/social/`. Entity facts and locked claims stay in [docs/search-visibility.md](../../../docs/search-visibility.md).

## Design system, every time

1. Read `docs/content/social/design-system.json` before writing a frame, a prompt, or a caption.
2. Colors are token names (`accent`, `carbon`, `aqua-deep`, …). The hex values are copied from `:root` in `src/app/globals.css`. If the CSS changes, update the JSON in the same change. Do not invent a green, a blue, or a gold.
3. Type is DM Serif Display (headlines, weight 400) and Plus Jakarta Sans (labels and body). The wordmark is the word `renew` in the serif and `implants` in small caps. There is no logo file. Do not draw a tooth icon in its place.
4. Light grounds use aqua eyebrows. Dark grounds use lime eyebrows. The CTA is always a fully rounded lime pill with near-black text.
5. A single thin aqua arch stroke is allowed. It reads as a jaw curve, not a logo.
6. Formats are declared in `design-system.json`:
   - `video` is 1080×1920, with a spoken line. The last 2.5 seconds are layout `video-end-card`.
   - `static` is one 1080×1350 frame, also cut to 1080×1080. No voiceover.
   - `carousel` is 1080×1350 slides. The last slide is layout `cta-still`.
7. Call `buildPromptPrefix()` from `src/lib/social-pipeline.ts` for any generated frame. Clinic stills must be paths in `approvedMedia`.

## Produce one unit

1. Pick a `ready` unit from `ads.json` (paid) or `organic-calendar.json` (feed). Skip anything that needs a signed social release.
2. Follow `format`. Video speaks `hook`, `spoken`, and `onScreen`. Static and carousel put `onScreen` and slide lines on the frame and use `body` as the caption. Do not paste the original Gemini hook back in. Do not turn a static or carousel unit into a video to save a setup.
3. The click goes to `ctaHref` (the implant quiz, about two minutes, nine questions). On video the phone `613-841-6111` may be spoken. On static and carousel it sits on the card. It is not a second price offer.
4. If `testimonialName` is set, the words must stay a verbatim excerpt of that review in `src/content/testimonials.ts`. Do not show that person’s face.
5. `concept-denture-slip` is a generated older adult with lived-in skin, wrinkles, and laugh lines. No name, no blood, no needles, no extra facial or hand features. The end card is still the design system.
6. Cross-posting follows `distribution.json`. Do not invent a third clinic, a new domain, or a city price page.

## Gate

```bash
npx vitest run src/lib/social-pipeline.test.ts
```

The test fails if a catalog collapses back to one format, a unit leaves the palette, a static or carousel grows a voiceover, a carousel skips the closing card, the copy quotes a price, calls Tom Szarski “Dr.”, says guarantee, or names a patient who is not in the review file.
